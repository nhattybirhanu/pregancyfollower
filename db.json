In the ovary, an egg ripens (sometimes, there can be two, either in the same or different ovaries), which by the end of the 2nd week (approximately on the 14th day of the 28-day cycle) leaves the follicle and enters the fallopian tube. Then comes ovulation, the most favorable time for conception.Read on to learn more about the first days of pregnancy and exactly what’s happening during the second week of pregnancy.",
