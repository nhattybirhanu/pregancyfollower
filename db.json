    {
        "Keyword": "Increased urination",
        "Detail": "You might find yourself urinating more often than usual. The amount of blood in your body increases during pregnancy, causing your kidneys to process extra fluid that ends up in your bladder."

Implantation bleeding occurs around the time of a menstrual period. However, not all women have it."

        "Detail": "When you're pregnant, you might become more sensitive to certain odors and your sense of taste might change. Like most other symptoms of pregnancy, these food preferences can be chalked up to hormonal changes."
