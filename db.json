                      Your doctor starts counting your pregnancy from the first day of your last period. That means that during the first two official weeks of your pregnancy, you won’t really be pregnant at all.

But even before conception, your body is getting ready for pregnancy. Many changes occur during these early days of pregnancy, and they’re essential for a healthy pregnancy.

A complex of hormones triggers monthly changes in a woman’s body, which prepare her for the upcoming pregnancy. During your second week of pregnancy, you’ve already had your last period before pregnancy and your body is preparing to ovulate. 

In the ovary, an egg ripens (sometimes, there can be two, either in the same or different ovaries), which by the end of the 2nd week (approximately on the 14th day of the 28-day cycle) leaves the follicle and enters the fallopian tube. Then comes ovulation, the most favorable time for conception.

Read on to learn more about the first days of pregnancy and exactly what’s happening during the second week of pregnancy.
